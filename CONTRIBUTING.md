# Contributing to Charm

Thanks for your interest in Charm!

We’re building our v1 release, featuring a federated runtime and middleware layer.

## Current Development Focus
We’re currently prioritizing **Agent Portability** — building the core pipeline that makes agents portable across frameworks.

You can refer to the [pipeline overview](https://github.com/CharmAIOS/Charm/blob/main/docs/pipeline.md) to understand the current implementation route and how the end-to-end flow works.

Contributions related to this are highly welcome. If you want to help in one of these areas, comment under the relevant GitHub Issue or @ucmind in Discussions.

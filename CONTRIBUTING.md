# Contributing to Charm

Thanks for your interest in Charm!

We’re building our v1 release, featuring a federated runtime and middleware layer.

## Current Development Focus
We’re currently prioritizing **Agent Portability** — building the core pipeline that makes agents portable across frameworks.

Please familiarize yourself with:
- [**Pipeline Overview**](https://github.com/CharmAIOS/Charm/blob/main/docs/pipeline.md)
- [**UAC**](https://github.com/CharmAIOS/Charm/tree/main/docs/contracts/uac)
- [**Fixtures**](https://github.com/CharmAIOS/Charm/tree/main/docs/fixtures)

Contributions related to this are highly welcome. If you want to help in one of these areas, comment under the relevant GitHub Issue or @ucmind in Discussions.

See the [docs](https://github.com/CharmAIOS/Charm/tree/main/docs) to learn more about Charm.
